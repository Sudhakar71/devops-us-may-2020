docker run --name mysql1 --hostname mysql1 -v /home/jegan/devops-us-may-2020/Day6/databases:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=admin123 -d mysql:5.6

In the above command, we named the container as 'mysql1' and its hosts as 'mysql1'.

We can get inside the container using the below command

docker exec -it mysql1 /bin/bash

We may launch mysql client inside mysql1 container ash show below

mysql -u root -p

We may create a database as shown below

CREATE DATABASE tektutor;

USE tektutor;

CREATE TABLE trainings (name VARCHAR(25), duration VARCHAR(15));

INSERT INTO trainings VALUES( 'DevOps', '5 days' );
INSERT INTO trainings VALUES( 'Python', '5 days' );
